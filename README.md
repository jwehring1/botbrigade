<b>Descripton</b><br />
BotBrigade is a web-based AI teaching game for learning basic to moderate AI concepts. These concepts are learned through the site's tutorials from greedy searches to alpha-beta pruning. Then the user can apply these concepts by writing their own AI code. When submitted, the user's AI competes against the other AI codes written on the site before it in a tournament style ranking. The user will then see how they compare against everyone on the site and can view other submittions to help them further their AI understanding.
